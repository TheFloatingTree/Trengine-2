# Trengine 2

A little JavaScript game engine developed on my free time :)

### Getting Started

- Make a new directory for the game
- Run `git clone https://github.com/thefloatingtree/Trengine-2.git` in the new directory
- Run `cd ./Trengine-2 && npm run init && cd ../`
- Run `npm start`

### Building for Development/Production

Modify the `PRODUCTION` key in the `.env` file
